These methods work fine, but they're often too specific and a bit clunky to work with. Especially if you're looking 
for a node inside a node inside a node. More recently, two new catchall methods have come along to solve pretty much 
all our targeting needs. Query Selector, which returns the first instance that matches the specified selectors, 
and Query Selector All which returns a node list of all elements that match the specified selectors. 
These selectors are one or more comma separated CSS selectors.
