## Specs

-  1) there should be a row of 4 colored circles 
-  2) clicking a colored circle should simultaneously change both the background color AND the color of the instruction text
-  3) the instruction text and the colored circles should remain static- only the background and font color should change

## BONUS feel free to add any additional styles
